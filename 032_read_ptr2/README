 1. Execute the code in "test.c" by hand, and write the output
    into a file called "answer.txt"

 2. Create a Makefile to compile test.c into a program called "test"
     
 3. Run test and use its output to check your work.

 4. Submit your Makefile and your answer.txt file

a=80 b=12
p->a q->b
f(r->p,s->q)
    tmp->p
    tmp2->q
    z->a
     r->q
    s->z->a
    **r = 12
    **s = 80
    a = 12+3=15
    a-=8=7
    b = b-19 = -7
    return 8
x = 8
p=15
q=-7
a=15
b=-7
