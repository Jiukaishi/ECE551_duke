` 1. Execute the code in "test.c" by hand, and write the output
    into a file called "answer.txt"

 2. Create a Makefile to compile test.c into a program called "test"
     
 3. Run test and use its output to check your work.

 4. Submit your Makefile and your answer.txt file

x=3 y=4
a->x b=4
In f, *a = 3, b
a->x = 3+4=7
b=8
g(x=7, y->b)
    In g, x = 7, *y =8
    x=8
    y->b = 0
In main: x = 7, y =4
